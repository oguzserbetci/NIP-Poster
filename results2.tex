    \caption{Examples from three human behaviors distinctly observed and replicated with RL agents. Behaviours by row: 1) Constant belief threshold, modelled by exponential utility, 2) Fixed time threshold, modelled by sinh utility, 3) mixed strategy, modelled by dynamic exponential utility. // Left column shows empirical optimal split of data using cross validation and linear kernel support vector machines, right column shows optimal policy found via gridsearch.}
